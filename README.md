## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

Build an AI-powered Resume Analyzer with React, React Router, and Puter.js! Implement seamless auth, upload and store resumes, and match candidates to jobs using smart AI evaluations. Get custom feedback and ATS scores tailored to each listing—all wrapped in a clean, reusable UI.


## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** is a popular open‑source JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components and a virtual DOM, enabling efficient, dynamic single-page and native apps.

- **[React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/)** is the go‑to routing library for React apps, offering nested routes, data loaders/actions, error boundaries, code splitting, and SSR support—all with a smooth upgrade path from v6.

- **[Puter.com](https://jsm.dev/resumind-puter)** is an advanced, open-source internet operating system designed to be feature-rich, exceptionally fast, and highly extensible. Puter can be used as: A privacy-first personal cloud to keep all your files, apps, and games in one secure place, accessible from anywhere at any time.

- **[Puter.js](https://jsm.dev/resumind-puterjs)** is a tiny client‑side SDK that adds serverless auth, storage, database, and AI (GPT, Claude, DALL·E, OCR…) straight into your browser app—no backend needed and costs borne by users.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom user interfaces by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML, streamlining the design process.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing better tooling, code quality, and error detection for developers, making it ideal for building large-scale applications.

- **[Vite](https://vite.dev/)** is a fast build tool and dev server using native ES modules for instant startup, hot‑module replacement, and Rollup‑powered production builds—perfect for modern web development.

- **[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)** is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.
